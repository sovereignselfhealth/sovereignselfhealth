                <p>You set an alarm for 6 AM with the best intentions. But when it goes off, you feel like you&rsquo;ve been hit by a truck. Dragging yourself out of bed takes an act of will. Coffee is non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Then something strange happens around 10 PM. Just when you should be winding down, you get a second wind. Your brain starts racing. You&rsquo;re suddenly productive—or at least, awake. By midnight, you&rsquo;re still scrolling, still wired, wondering why sleep feels so far away.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a discipline problem. It&rsquo;s a <strong>cortisol rhythm problem</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cortisol-really">What Is Cortisol, Really?</h2>
<p>Cortisol gets a bad rap as &ldquo;the stress hormone,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s only part of the story. Cortisol is your body&rsquo;s built-in energy regulation system. In a healthy body, it follows a predictable 24-hour pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest in the morning</strong> (helping you wake up and feel alert)</li>
<li><strong>Gradually declining through the day</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lowest at night</strong> (allowing melatonin to rise and sleep to come)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called your <strong>cortisol awakening response (CAR)</strong>, and when it&rsquo;s working, you feel like a functional human being.</p>
<h2 id="the-5-signs-your-rhythm-is-off">The 5 Signs Your Rhythm Is Off</h2>
<h3 id="1-you-cant-wake-up-without-caffeine">1. You Can&rsquo;t Wake Up Without Caffeine</h3>
<p>A healthy cortisol spike should have you naturally alert within 30-60 minutes of waking. If you&rsquo;re reaching for coffee before your feet hit the floor, your morning cortisol may be blunted.</p>
<h3 id="2-you-crash-hard-in-the-afternoon">2. You Crash Hard in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>That 2-3 PM energy dip isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; While some dip is expected, feeling like you need a nap to survive suggests your cortisol is dropping too fast, too early.</p>
<h3 id="3-you-get-a-second-wind-at-night">3. You Get a &ldquo;Second Wind&rdquo; at Night</h3>
<p>This is the classic sign of a flipped rhythm. Your cortisol is rising when it should be falling, making you alert when you should be sleepy.</p>
<h3 id="4-you-wake-up-between-2-4-am">4. You Wake Up Between 2-4 AM</h3>
<p>This often indicates a blood sugar crash (cortisol and blood sugar are tightly linked) or a cortisol spike in the middle of the night when it should be at its lowest.</p>
<h3 id="5-you-feel-tired-but-wired">5. You Feel &ldquo;Tired But Wired&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This paradox—exhausted but unable to relax—is the hallmark of HPA axis dysfunction. Your body is stuck in a stress response it can&rsquo;t turn off.</p>
<h2 id="whats-actually-happening">What&rsquo;s Actually Happening</h2>
<p>Your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the command center for cortisol production. When you&rsquo;re under chronic stress—whether from work, poor sleep, gut infections, or hidden inflammation—this system can get dysregulated.</p>
<p>The result? Your cortisol curve flattens. Instead of a healthy peak-and-valley pattern, you get a flat line that leaves you dragging all day and wired all night.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do-about-it">What To Do About It</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: you can&rsquo;t fix what you can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>Guessing at supplements or sleep hacks without knowing your actual cortisol pattern is like trying to fix a car without looking under the hood.</p>
<p>A <strong>salivary cortisol test</strong> measures your levels at multiple points throughout the day, revealing exactly where your rhythm is broken. From there, we can build a targeted protocol to restore healthy function.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we do in the D.R.E.S.S. protocol—using data to drive decisions, not guesswork.</p>
