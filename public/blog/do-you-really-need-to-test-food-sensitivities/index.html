                <p>You&rsquo;re bloated after every meal. Your joints ache. Your skin breaks out. You have brain fog that won&rsquo;t quit.</p>
<p>Someone tells you, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably a food sensitivity. Just cut out gluten, dairy, soy, eggs, nuts, and nightshades for 30 days and see how you feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you do it. You eliminate half your diet. You eat plain chicken, rice, and steamed broccoli for a month.</p>
<p>And&hellip; maybe you feel a little better? Or maybe not. Hard to tell. You&rsquo;re also miserable, starving, and avoiding social situations because you can&rsquo;t eat anything.</p>
<p>Then you reintroduce foods. Gluten seems fine. Dairy makes you bloated. Eggs maybe? You&rsquo;re not sure. Almonds might be a problem, or maybe that was just a bad day.</p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;re more confused than when you started.</strong></p>
<p>Now someone else says, &ldquo;Just get a food sensitivity test. It&rsquo;ll tell you exactly what to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You drop $300-400 on an IgG food panel. It comes back showing you&rsquo;re &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; to 25 foods—including things you eat every day and have never had a problem with.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re REALLY confused.</p>
<p><strong>So what&rsquo;s the truth? Do you actually need food sensitivity testing, or is it just another overhyped, overpriced test that doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything useful?</strong></p>
<p>The answer: <strong>It depends.</strong></p>
<p>Let me break down when food sensitivity testing is worth it, when it&rsquo;s a waste of money, and what you should do instead.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-what-are-food-sensitivities-and-how-are-they-different-from-allergies">First: What Are Food Sensitivities? (And How Are They Different From Allergies?)</h2>
<p>Before we talk about testing, let&rsquo;s get clear on what we&rsquo;re actually testing for.</p>
<h3 id="food-allergies-ige-mediated"><strong>Food Allergies (IgE-Mediated)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate immune reactions (within minutes to 2 hours)</li>
<li>Mediated by IgE antibodies</li>
<li>Can be life-threatening (anaphylaxis—think peanut allergies, shellfish allergies)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, throat closing</li>
<li>Immediate and severe</li>
<li>You KNOW when you have an IgE allergy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Skin prick test or IgE blood test</li>
<li>Performed by allergists</li>
<li>Reliable and well-established</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have a true IgE food allergy, you already know. This article isn&rsquo;t about that.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="food-sensitivities-igg-mediated"><strong>Food Sensitivities (IgG-Mediated)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delayed immune reactions (hours to days after eating)</li>
<li>Mediated by IgG antibodies (NOT IgE)</li>
<li>NOT life-threatening, but can cause chronic low-grade inflammation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation</li>
<li>Headaches, brain fog</li>
<li>Joint pain, muscle aches</li>
<li>Skin issues (acne, eczema, rashes)</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Mood changes (anxiety, irritability, depression)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why they&rsquo;re hard to identify:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delayed reaction (you ate eggs at breakfast, but don&rsquo;t feel symptoms until dinner—how do you connect the dots?)</li>
<li>Cumulative effect (eating a food once might be fine, but eating it daily causes problems)</li>
<li>Symptoms are vague and overlap with other issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is what IgG food sensitivity testing is trying to identify.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="food-intolerances-non-immune-reactions"><strong>Food Intolerances (Non-Immune Reactions)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What they are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NOT an immune response</li>
<li>Your body lacks enzymes or mechanisms to properly digest certain foods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lactose intolerance:</strong> Lack of lactase enzyme (can&rsquo;t break down milk sugar)</li>
<li><strong>Fructose malabsorption:</strong> Can&rsquo;t absorb fructose properly</li>
<li><strong>Histamine intolerance:</strong> Can&rsquo;t break down histamine (found in aged foods, fermented foods, leftovers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Digestive issues (bloating, gas, diarrhea)</li>
<li>Headaches (histamine intolerance)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Breath tests (for lactose, fructose)</li>
<li>Elimination and reintroduction</li>
<li>DAO enzyme levels (for histamine intolerance)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Food sensitivity tests (IgG) don&rsquo;t detect intolerances.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-controversy-does-igg-testing-actually-work">The Controversy: Does IgG Testing Actually Work?</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get messy.</p>
<p><strong>IgG food sensitivity testing is controversial in the medical community.</strong></p>
<h3 id="critics-say"><strong>Critics say:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;IgG antibodies are a normal response to food—not a sign of sensitivity.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>When you eat food, your immune system produces IgG antibodies as part of normal digestion. It&rsquo;s how your body recognizes food proteins.</p>
<p><strong>The presence of IgG antibodies doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; to that food—it might just mean you eat it regularly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;IgG testing has poor reproducibility.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Some studies show that if you test the same person twice, the results can vary significantly. One test shows reactivity to eggs, the next test doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Eliminating foods based on IgG results can lead to unnecessary dietary restriction.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If your test shows 30 reactive foods, you might eliminate nutritious foods you&rsquo;re not actually sensitive to—leading to nutrient deficiencies and disordered eating.</p>
<h3 id="proponents-including-many-functional-practitioners-say"><strong>Proponents (including many functional practitioners) say:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Elevated IgG to specific foods correlates with symptoms.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>In practice, many people DO feel better when they remove high-IgG foods—even if the science isn&rsquo;t perfectly clear on WHY.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;IgG testing is useful in the context of intestinal permeability.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If you have leaky gut, undigested food particles pass through the gut lining and trigger IgG production. In this case, elevated IgG indicates foods that are driving inflammation DUE to leaky gut—not because the food itself is inherently &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;It provides a starting point for elimination.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Instead of randomly eliminating 10-15 foods and guessing, IgG testing gives you a targeted list to test systematically.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-does-igg-testing-work-or-not">So&hellip; Does IgG Testing Work or Not?</h2>
<p><strong>My take:</strong></p>
<p><strong>IgG food sensitivity testing can be useful—BUT:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s not perfect.</strong> The science is mixed, and results can vary.</li>
<li><strong>It needs to be interpreted in CONTEXT.</strong> If you have leaky gut, gut infections, or chronic inflammation, elevated IgG makes sense. If your gut is healthy, elevated IgG might just mean you eat those foods regularly.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s a tool, not a diagnosis.</strong> Use it as a starting point for elimination and reintroduction—not as a permanent &ldquo;these foods are poison&rdquo; list.</li>
<li><strong>It&rsquo;s expensive.</strong> $300-400 for a test. If you can&rsquo;t afford it, a well-executed elimination diet can work just as well (though it takes more effort).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When IgG testing is worth it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have multiple vague symptoms (bloating, brain fog, joint pain, skin issues)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve tried eliminating common triggers (gluten, dairy) but still feel bad</li>
<li>You suspect you&rsquo;re reacting to foods but don&rsquo;t know which ones</li>
<li>You want a targeted starting point rather than eliminating 15 foods randomly</li>
<li>You have leaky gut or chronic inflammation (confirmed by labs)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When IgG testing is NOT worth it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re asymptomatic (no digestive, skin, joint, or energy issues)</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t afford it and would rather do an elimination diet</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re looking for a &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; without addressing gut health</li>
<li>You plan to eliminate reactive foods forever without healing the gut (not the goal)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-to-do-instead-the-strategic-approach-to-food-sensitivities">What to Do Instead: The Strategic Approach to Food Sensitivities</h2>
<p>Whether you test or not, here&rsquo;s the process that actually works:</p>
<h3 id="option-1-start-with-an-elimination-diet-no-testing-required"><strong>Option 1: Start with an Elimination Diet (No Testing Required)</strong></h3>
<p>An elimination diet is the gold standard for identifying food sensitivities—and it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Eliminate Common Triggers (2-4 Weeks)</strong></p>
<p>Remove the most common inflammatory foods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gluten (wheat, barley, rye)</li>
<li>Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt, butter)</li>
<li>Soy</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Corn</li>
<li>Peanuts</li>
<li>Tree nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc.)</li>
<li>Shellfish</li>
<li>Nightshades (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why these?</strong> They&rsquo;re the most common IgG triggers. If you&rsquo;re reacting to something, it&rsquo;s likely on this list.</p>
<p><strong>What to eat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quality proteins: Chicken, turkey, beef, lamb, fish (not shellfish)</li>
<li>Vegetables: All except nightshades</li>
<li>Fruits: Berries, apples, pears (low-sugar)</li>
<li>Healthy fats: Olive oil, avocado, coconut oil</li>
<li>Gluten-free grains: Rice, quinoa (if tolerated)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Reintroduce One Food at a Time (1 Week Per Food)</strong></p>
<p>After 2-4 weeks of elimination, start reintroducing foods ONE AT A TIME.</p>
<p><strong>How to reintroduce:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: Eat the food 2-3 times (e.g., eggs for breakfast, eggs for lunch)</li>
<li>Days 2-3: Remove the food again and watch for delayed reactions</li>
<li>Day 4-7: If no symptoms, that food is likely fine. Move to the next food.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to watch for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Digestive symptoms (bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation)</li>
<li>Skin reactions (acne, rashes, eczema flare-ups)</li>
<li>Energy changes (fatigue, brain fog)</li>
<li>Joint pain or muscle aches</li>
<li>Mood changes (anxiety, irritability)</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If symptoms occur, that food is a trigger. Eliminate it for 90 days while you heal your gut.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros of elimination diet:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Gold standard (correlates symptoms directly with food exposure)</li>
<li>You learn to tune into your body</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time-consuming (2-3 months total)</li>
<li>Requires discipline and careful tracking</li>
<li>Hard to do if you eat out frequently or have social obligations</li>
<li>Can be overwhelming if you react to multiple foods</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="option-2-test-first-then-eliminate-strategically-igg-testing"><strong>Option 2: Test First, Then Eliminate Strategically (IgG Testing)</strong></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;d rather have a targeted starting point, run an IgG food sensitivity panel.</p>
<p><strong>Best tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MRT/LEAP</strong> (Mediator Release Test)—measures immune cell reactions, not just IgG (US only, requires working with a LEAP-certified practitioner)</li>
<li><strong>Great Plains IgG Food Panel</strong> (tests 90-190 foods, available internationally)</li>
<li><strong>Cyrex Array 3</strong> or <strong>Array 4</strong> (gluten reactivity and cross-reactivity)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to interpret results:</strong></p>
<p>Most tests categorize foods as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green (Low/No reactivity):</strong> Likely safe</li>
<li><strong>Yellow (Moderate reactivity):</strong> Possible trigger</li>
<li><strong>Red (High reactivity):</strong> Strong trigger</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Eliminate all RED foods for 90 days</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eliminate YELLOW foods for 30-60 days</strong> (or test them one at a time in an elimination/reintroduction protocol)</li>
<li><strong>Eat GREEN foods freely</strong> (but rotate them—don&rsquo;t eat the same thing every single day)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>After 90 days, retest or reintroduce:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your gut has healed, many sensitivities will resolve</li>
<li>Reintroduce foods one at a time (same process as elimination diet)</li>
<li>Some foods may always be triggers (especially if you have autoimmune conditions like Celiac)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros of testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Targeted starting point (no guessing)</li>
<li>Faster than eliminating 10+ foods blindly</li>
<li>Can identify surprising triggers (foods you thought were &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive ($300-400)</li>
<li>Not 100% accurate</li>
<li>Results need to be interpreted in context (leaky gut, inflammation)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="option-3-the-hybrid-approach-my-recommendation"><strong>Option 3: The Hybrid Approach (My Recommendation)</strong></h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I do with clients:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Run a GI-MAP Stool Test First</strong></p>
<p>Before testing food sensitivities, I want to know what&rsquo;s happening in the gut.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Food sensitivities are often a SYMPTOM of an underlying gut problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaky gut (intestinal permeability)</li>
<li>Gut infections (bacteria, parasites, yeast)</li>
<li>Dysbiosis (imbalanced gut bacteria)</li>
<li>Low stomach acid or digestive enzymes</li>
<li>Chronic inflammation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have gut infections or leaky gut, you&rsquo;ll react to MANY foods—not because the foods are bad, but because your gut barrier is compromised.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fixing the gut often resolves 50-70% of food sensitivities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Eliminate Common Triggers (Gluten, Dairy) While Addressing Gut Health</strong></p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re working on healing the gut (antimicrobials, probiotics, gut-lining support), eliminate the big ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gluten (inflammatory for almost everyone, especially with leaky gut)</li>
<li>Dairy (casein and lactose are common triggers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Run IgG Testing (If Symptoms Persist After Gut Healing)</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve healed the gut and still have symptoms, THEN run IgG testing to identify remaining triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Eliminate Reactive Foods for 90 Days, Then Reintroduce</strong></p>
<p>Use the IgG results as a guide, eliminate reactive foods, continue gut healing, then reintroduce one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Why this approach works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses root cause (gut dysfunction) FIRST</li>
<li>Avoids unnecessary dietary restriction</li>
<li>Uses testing strategically (not as the first step)</li>
<li>Saves money (you might not need the test if gut healing resolves symptoms)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-to-do-instead-the-action-plan">What to Do Instead: The Action Plan</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your step-by-step process:</p>
<h3 id="step-1-assess-your-symptoms"><strong>Step 1: Assess Your Symptoms</strong></h3>
<p>Do you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic digestive issues (bloating, gas, irregular bowel movements)</li>
<li>Skin problems (acne, eczema, rashes)</li>
<li>Joint pain or inflammation</li>
<li>Brain fog, fatigue, mood issues</li>
<li>Unexplained headaches</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If yes, food sensitivities might be part of the picture.</strong></p>
<h3 id="step-2-test-your-gut-first"><strong>Step 2: Test Your Gut First</strong></h3>
<p>Run a <strong>GI-MAP stool test</strong> to identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infections (bacteria, parasites, yeast)</li>
<li>Dysbiosis (imbalanced gut bacteria)</li>
<li>Inflammation markers (calprotectin, lactoferrin)</li>
<li>Digestive function (elastase, fat digestion)</li>
<li>Intestinal permeability markers (zonulin, if testing includes mucosal barrier)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have gut infections or dysbiosis, address these FIRST before worrying about food sensitivities.</strong></p>
<h3 id="step-3-eliminate-gluten-and-dairy-the-big-two"><strong>Step 3: Eliminate Gluten and Dairy (The Big Two)</strong></h3>
<p>While you&rsquo;re healing the gut, remove:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gluten</strong> (wheat, barley, rye)</li>
<li><strong>Dairy</strong> (especially casein-containing products)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most inflammatory for most people, especially with compromised gut integrity.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-decide-elimination-diet-or-igg-testing"><strong>Step 4: Decide: Elimination Diet or IgG Testing</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Choose elimination diet if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Budget is tight</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re disciplined and can track carefully</li>
<li>You have time (2-3 months)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choose IgG testing if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You want a targeted starting point</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve already eliminated gluten/dairy and still have symptoms</li>
<li>You suspect you&rsquo;re reacting to multiple foods but don&rsquo;t know which ones</li>
<li>You can afford $300-400</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-5-address-gut-health-simultaneously"><strong>Step 5: Address Gut Health Simultaneously</strong></h3>
<p>Food sensitivity elimination is NOT the end goal. Healing the gut is.</p>
<p><strong>Support gut healing with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Antimicrobials (if infections present)</li>
<li>Probiotics (after clearing infections)</li>
<li>Digestive enzymes (if low on labs)</li>
<li>Gut-lining support: L-glutamine, zinc carnosine, aloe, collagen/bone broth</li>
<li>Anti-inflammatory diet (whole foods, quality proteins, healthy fats, vegetables)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-6-reintroduce-foods-after-90-days"><strong>Step 6: Reintroduce Foods After 90 Days</strong></h3>
<p>Once your gut is healthier (confirmed by symptom improvement or retesting), reintroduce foods one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Expand your diet as much as possible while avoiding true triggers.</p>
<p><strong>Some foods may always be off the table:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have Celiac, gluten is non-negotiable forever</li>
<li>If you have severe casein sensitivity, dairy might always cause issues</li>
<li>But many sensitivities resolve once the gut heals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line-testing-is-a-tool-not-a-magic-answer">The Bottom Line: Testing Is a Tool, Not a Magic Answer</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Food sensitivity testing (IgG) can be useful—BUT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not perfect</li>
<li>It needs to be interpreted in context (gut health, inflammation)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a starting point, not a permanent food blacklist</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s expensive (elimination diet is free and just as effective if you&rsquo;re disciplined)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The real solution isn&rsquo;t just avoiding foods—it&rsquo;s healing the gut:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Test your gut first (GI-MAP)</li>
<li>Address infections, dysbiosis, inflammation</li>
<li>Support gut-lining repair</li>
<li>THEN identify and eliminate remaining food triggers</li>
<li>Reintroduce foods after 90 days of gut healing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most food sensitivities are symptoms of leaky gut—not permanent intolerances.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fix the gut, and many sensitivities resolve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stop guessing which foods are the problem. Start testing your gut, healing the root cause, and strategically identifying triggers.</strong></p>
