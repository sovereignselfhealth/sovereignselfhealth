                <h3 id="kyle">Kyle</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Functional Diagnostic Nutrition Practitioner and Precision Nutrition Master Health Coach.
I help people who are tired of being tired find the hidden stressors in their biology—and resolve them for good.</p>
<h3 id="30-years-of-trial-error-and-truth">30 Years of Trial, Error, and Truth</h3>
<p>Let me guess: You&rsquo;re exhausted. Your gut&rsquo;s a mess. You&rsquo;ve got mystery aches, stubborn weight that won&rsquo;t budge, or a brain that feels wrapped in cotton. You&rsquo;ve seen doctors. Run tests. Been told &ldquo;everything looks normal.&rdquo; Meanwhile, you feel like absolute garbage.</p>
<p>I know exactly what that&rsquo;s like. I lived it for 24 years before anyone figured out what was wrong.</p>
<h3 id="the-long-decline">The Long Decline</h3>
<p>In 1991, I joined the US Marine Corps. By 1993, I was in Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. When I came back in 1995, something was broken. Random infections. GI issues. Brain fog. Fatigue that sleep couldn&rsquo;t touch.</p>
<p>Doctors had no answers. For the next 24 years, I got misdiagnosed, dismissed, or told it was stress.</p>
<p>From 2016 to 2019, things went critical. I dropped from 240 pounds to 170. At 6'5&quot;, I looked like death. Muscle wasting. Couldn&rsquo;t think straight. Could barely function. Finally, in 2020, the VA ran the right tests: Celiac disease and liver damage.</p>
<p>Twenty-four years. That&rsquo;s how long it took them to figure it out.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-for-answers">The Search for Answers</h3>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t just sit around waiting for doctors to save me. I started searching for answers in 1996. In 2005, I trained at the Global College of Natural Medicine as a Holistic Health Practitioner and Master Herbalist. I thought I&rsquo;d found the solution.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The decline continued. By 2017, when I became a Licensed Massage Therapist, my health obsession reignited. This time I went all in: NASM Personal Trainer and Corrective Exercise Specialist. Precision Nutrition Level 1, then Sleep, Stress, and Recovery coaching. Studied Ayurveda and Jyotish. Got certified with The Ready State. Completed the entire Precision Nutrition catalog. BioForce Certified Conditioning Coach.</p>
<p>I was collecting tools, trying to build a complete picture of how the body actually works and heals. The Celiac diagnosis in 2020 helped—I finally started recovering, climbing from 170 back to 210 pounds. But something was still missing.</p>
<p>All these certifications, all these modalities, all this knowledge—but no unified framework to tie it together.</p>
<h3 id="everything-clicked">Everything Clicked</h3>
<p>Then in June 2025, I found Functional Diagnostic Nutrition.</p>
<p>Suddenly, 30 years of study made sense. FDN doesn&rsquo;t just treat symptoms or follow trendy protocols. It uses foundational labs to uncover what&rsquo;s actually broken—hormone imbalances, gut infections, immune dysfunction, toxicity—then addresses it through the DRESS protocol: Diet, Rest, Exercise, Stress reduction, Supplementation.</p>
<p>Every certification I&rsquo;d earned, every modality I&rsquo;d studied, every mistake I&rsquo;d made on myself—FDN gave me the framework to use it all with precision. Labs eliminate the guessing. The DRESS protocol provides the roadmap. My three decades of trial and error became practical, proven tools.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;d been searching for since 1996.</p>
<h3 id="test-dont-guess">Test Don&rsquo;t Guess</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what 30 years taught me: Your symptoms aren&rsquo;t the problem. They&rsquo;re messengers. Most health practitioners—even good ones—are guessing based on symptom patterns and whatever&rsquo;s popular this year.</p>
<p>FDN cuts through the noise with data. We run labs. We find what&rsquo;s broken. We fix it systematically using the DRESS protocol. No trends. No theories. Just evidence and action.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived both sides of this. I know what it&rsquo;s like to waste away while doctors shrug. I also know what it takes to rebuild from 170 pounds of wreckage to 210 pounds of functional strength. I haven&rsquo;t driven a car in 25 years—I cycle everywhere. I play racquetball. I live the life the VA told me was impossible.</p>
<h3 id="why-work-with-me">Why Work With Me</h3>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve spent 30 years in the trenches. I&rsquo;ve lived with chronic illness. I&rsquo;ve been dismissed by the medical system. I&rsquo;ve earned every certification looking for answers. And I&rsquo;ve finally found the methodology that brings it all together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do wellness trends. I don&rsquo;t do social media nonsense. I do labs, data, and protocols backed by three decades of study and personal proof.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tired of being told &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in your head&rdquo; or &ldquo;just try this diet,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re in the right place.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s find out what&rsquo;s really going on. Test don&rsquo;t guess.</strong></p>
