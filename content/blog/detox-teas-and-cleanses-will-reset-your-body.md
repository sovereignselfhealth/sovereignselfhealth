## Myth #1: "Detox Teas and Cleanses Will Reset Your Body"

Walk into any health food store or scroll Instagram for 5 minutes, and you'll see:
- Detox teas promising to "flush toxins"
- 3-day juice cleanses that "reset your system"
- Colon cleanses that claim to remove "years of built-up waste"

**The claim:** Your body is full of toxins, and you need special products to detox.

**The reality:** Your body detoxes itself—every single day—through your liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, and gut. That's literally their job.

### Why This Myth Is Harmful:

**1. It Oversimplifies Detoxification**

Detoxification isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing process that happens 24/7 through two main phases:

- **Phase 1 (Liver):** Enzymes convert fat-soluble toxins into intermediate compounds
- **Phase 2 (Liver):** These intermediates are made water-soluble so they can be excreted via urine or stool

**Your body doesn't need a "cleanse"—it needs the right nutrients and conditions to support these pathways.**

**2. Most Detox Products Are Just Laxatives**

That "teatox" you bought? It's probably senna, cascara, or another herbal laxative.

You're not "detoxing"—you're just spending a lot of time on the toilet.

**Long-term laxative use:**
- Damages gut motility (your bowels become dependent)
- Depletes electrolytes (potassium, magnesium)
- Doesn't address WHY you're constipated in the first place

**3. Juice Cleanses Spike Blood Sugar and Starve Your Body**

A 3-day juice cleanse gives you:
- No protein (your body breaks down muscle for amino acids)
- No fat (you need fat for hormone production)
- Tons of sugar (even from fruit—your blood sugar is a rollercoaster)
- No fiber (juice removes the fiber from fruits and veggies)

**You'll lose weight—mostly water, muscle, and glycogen. Not fat. Not "toxins."**

And you'll gain it all back (plus more) when you start eating again.

### What to Do Instead:

**Support Your Body's Natural Detox Pathways:**

**1. Fix Your Gut**
- If you're constipated, you're reabsorbing toxins instead of eliminating them
- Run a comprehensive stool test (GI-MAP) to identify infections, dysbiosis, low enzyme production
- Support with probiotics, fiber, adequate hydration

**2. Support Your Liver**
- The liver needs specific nutrients for Phase 1 and Phase 2 detox:
  - **Phase 1:** B vitamins, antioxidants (Vitamin C, E), glutathione precursors
  - **Phase 2:** Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts), sulfur (eggs, garlic, onions), glycine, taurine
- Reduce liver burden: limit alcohol, processed foods, excess fructose, environmental toxins

**3. Test, Don't Guess**
- Organic Acids Test (OAT) or Metabolic Wellness Profile shows how well your detox pathways are functioning
- You can see if Phase 1 or Phase 2 is struggling and supplement specifically

**Bottom Line:**
Skip the teatox. Eat real food, support your liver and gut, and your body will detox just fine on its own.
