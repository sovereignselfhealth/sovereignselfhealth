## Myth #5: "Your Thyroid Is Fine - Your TSH Is Normal"

You're exhausted. You can't lose weight. Your hair is falling out. You're cold all the time. Your brain feels like mush.

You go to the doctor. They run a TSH test. It comes back "normal."

"Your thyroid is fine," they say. "Maybe try exercising more and eating less."

**The claim:** TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is the definitive test for thyroid function. If it's in range, your thyroid is fine.

**The reality:** TSH alone tells you almost nothing about how your thyroid is actually functioning.

### Why This Myth Is Harmful:

**1. TSH Is an Indirect Measure**

TSH is a pituitary hormone that TELLS your thyroid to produce hormones. It doesn't measure the actual thyroid hormones themselves.

**It's like measuring how loud your boss is yelling at you to work, not how much work you're actually getting done.**

You could have:
- High TSH (pituitary screaming at thyroid to produce more)
- But low thyroid hormones (thyroid can't keep up)

OR:

- "Normal" TSH
- But low FREE T3 (the active thyroid hormone your cells actually use)
- You're still hypothyroid—TSH just hasn't caught up yet

**2. The Reference Range Is Too Wide**

Standard TSH reference range: 0.5 - 4.5 or 5.0 mIU/L (varies by lab)

**Optimal TSH: 0.5 - 2.5 mIU/L**

Someone with a TSH of 3.8 is "normal" by conventional standards—but they're likely symptomatic:
- Fatigue
- Weight gain
- Hair loss
- Cold intolerance
- Brain fog
- Constipation
- Depression

**Most people feel best with TSH between 1.0 - 2.0.**

**3. It Doesn't Test Conversion or Autoimmunity**

Your thyroid produces mostly **T4** (inactive hormone).

Your body has to CONVERT T4 → **T3** (active hormone that your cells use).

**If conversion is impaired (due to stress, inflammation, nutrient deficiencies, gut issues), you'll have:**
- Normal TSH
- Normal T4
- **Low T3** ← THIS is why you feel terrible

**Also: Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism)**
- Your immune system is attacking your thyroid
- TSH might still be "normal" in early stages
- But you have elevated thyroid antibodies (TPO, Tg)
- You're hypothyroid—it just hasn't fully manifested yet

**Conventional testing doesn't check antibodies unless TSH is out of range. By then, you've had Hashimoto's for YEARS.**

### What to Do Instead:

**1. Run a FULL Thyroid Panel**

Don't accept just TSH. Demand (or order yourself):

- **TSH** (pituitary signal)
- **Free T4** (inactive hormone produced by thyroid)
- **Free T3** (active hormone—this is what matters most)
- **Reverse T3** (inactive form that blocks T3—elevated in stress, inflammation)
- **TPO antibodies** (Hashimoto's marker)
- **Thyroglobulin antibodies** (another Hashimoto's marker)

**This gives you the FULL picture.**

**2. Look at Optimal Ranges, Not Just "Normal"**

| Marker | Standard Range | Optimal Range |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| TSH | 0.5 - 4.5 mIU/L | 1.0 - 2.0 mIU/L |
| Free T4 | 0.8 - 1.8 ng/dL | Top half of range |
| Free T3 | 2.3 - 4.2 pg/mL | Top third of range |
| Reverse T3 | <15 ng/dL | <10 ng/dL |
| TPO antibodies | <35 IU/mL | <9 IU/mL (ideally 0) |

**If your numbers are "in range" but at the low or high end, you're not optimal—and you'll feel it.**

**3. Address Root Causes of Poor Thyroid Function**

**Common causes of low T3 or poor conversion:**
- **Chronic stress** (elevated cortisol impairs T4 → T3 conversion)
- **Inflammation** (gut infections, food sensitivities)
- **Nutrient deficiencies** (selenium, zinc, iodine, iron, Vitamin D)
- **Gut dysfunction** (70% of T4 → T3 conversion happens in the gut)
- **Liver dysfunction** (the liver converts T4 → T3)

**For Hashimoto's:**
- Remove gluten (major trigger for Hashimoto's)
- Test for and address gut infections
- Reduce inflammation
- Support with selenium, Vitamin D, fish oil
- Consider LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone) with your doctor

**Bottom Line:**
Don't accept "your TSH is normal" as the end of the conversation. Demand a full thyroid panel and look at OPTIMAL ranges, not just "in range."
