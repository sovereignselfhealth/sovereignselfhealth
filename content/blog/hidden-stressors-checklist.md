You've tried everything: more sleep, cleaner diet, supplements. But you still wake up exhausted.

The problem? You're addressing the *obvious* stressors while missing the hidden ones.

## 1. Blue Light After Dark

Your circadian rhythm depends on darkness signals. Even dim screens tell your brain it's still daytime, suppressing melatonin for hours.

**What to do:** Install f.lux on your computer, use blue-blocking glasses after 8 PM, or switch devices to grayscale mode.

## 2. Mouth Breathing During Sleep

Breathing through your mouth all night triggers stress hormones, disrupts CO2 levels, and prevents deep sleep.

**What to do:** Try mouth tape (3M Micropore tape). Sounds weird, works brilliantly.

## 3. Chronic Under-Eating

"Eating less" seems healthy, but if you're under-eating protein or carbs chronically, your body interprets it as famine—a massive stressor.

**What to do:** Track your intake for 3 days. Most people discover they're eating 30-40% less than they thought.
