## Myth #3: "Everyone Should Follow [Insert Diet Here]"

Keto. Paleo. Vegan. Carnivore. Low-fat. High-carb. Intermittent fasting.

**The claim:** There's ONE perfect diet that works for everyone.

**The reality:** There's no one-size-fits-all diet. What works for your friend, your trainer, or the influencer you follow might be terrible for YOUR body.

### Why This Myth Is Harmful:

**1. It Ignores Bio-Individuality**

Your genetics, metabolic type, gut microbiome, stress levels, activity level, and health history all affect how you respond to food.

**Example: Keto**
- Person A: Thrives on keto (high fat, low carb). Energy soars, mental clarity improves, weight drops.
- Person B: Feels terrible on keto. Exhausted, brain fog, workouts suffer, thyroid tanks.

**Why?** They have different metabolic types.

- **Person A** is a **fast oxidizer** (burns through carbs quickly, needs more fat and protein)
- **Person B** is a **slow oxidizer** (needs more carbs for energy, too much fat makes them sluggish)

**The diet isn't "good" or "bad"—it's right or wrong for YOUR body.**

**2. It Creates Orthorexia and Food Fear**

When you believe there's ONE right way to eat, you develop:
- Fear of "bad" foods
- Guilt when you eat outside the diet
- Social isolation (can't eat at restaurants, avoid gatherings)
- Obsession with food rules

**Health isn't about perfection. It's about finding what works for your body and sustainably supporting it.**

**3. It Ignores Food Sensitivities**

You can eat a "perfect" diet—organic, whole foods, no processed junk—and still feel terrible if you're eating foods YOUR body reacts to.

**Common "healthy" foods that cause reactions:**
- Eggs (high in histamine, common IgG sensitivity)
- Almonds (oxalates, IgG sensitivity)
- Spinach (high oxalates—can contribute to kidney stones, joint pain)
- Tomatoes (nightshade—triggers inflammation for some)
- Gluten-free grains (cross-reactivity in Celiac patients)

**You won't know unless you test.**

### What to Do Instead:

**1. Determine Your Metabolic Type**
- Metabolic Typing questionnaire or blood test
- Identifies if you're a fast oxidizer, slow oxidizer, or mixed type
- Tells you your ideal macronutrient ratio (protein/fat/carb balance)

**2. Test for Food Sensitivities**
- IgG food sensitivity panel (tests 150+ foods)
- Identifies delayed reactions (not the same as allergies)
- Remove reactive foods for 90 days, heal the gut, reintroduce

**3. Follow Universal Principles, Then Personalize**

**Universal principles (work for almost everyone):**
- Eat whole, unprocessed foods
- Get adequate protein (0.7-1g per pound of body weight)
- Include healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish)
- Eat plenty of vegetables (fiber, nutrients, antioxidants)
- Balance blood sugar (don't skip meals, avoid high-carb meals without protein/fat)
- Stay hydrated

**Then personalize:**
- Adjust carb/fat ratio based on metabolic type
- Remove foods YOU react to
- Time meals based on YOUR energy and digestion
- Adjust based on activity level, stress, sleep

**Bottom Line:**
Stop chasing the "perfect diet." Start eating for YOUR body based on objective data (metabolic typing + food sensitivities).
