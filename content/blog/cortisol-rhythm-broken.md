You set an alarm for 6 AM with the best intentions. But when it goes off, you feel like you've been hit by a truck. Dragging yourself out of bed takes an act of will. Coffee is non-negotiable.

Then something strange happens around 10 PM. Just when you should be winding down, you get a second wind. Your brain starts racing. You're suddenly productive—or at least, awake. By midnight, you're still scrolling, still wired, wondering why sleep feels so far away.

Sound familiar?

This isn't a discipline problem. It's a **cortisol rhythm problem**.

## What Is Cortisol, Really?

Cortisol gets a bad rap as "the stress hormone," but that's only part of the story. Cortisol is your body's built-in energy regulation system. In a healthy body, it follows a predictable 24-hour pattern:

- **Highest in the morning** (helping you wake up and feel alert)
- **Gradually declining through the day**
- **Lowest at night** (allowing melatonin to rise and sleep to come)

This is called your **cortisol awakening response (CAR)**, and when it's working, you feel like a functional human being.

## The 5 Signs Your Rhythm Is Off

### 1. You Can't Wake Up Without Caffeine

A healthy cortisol spike should have you naturally alert within 30-60 minutes of waking. If you're reaching for coffee before your feet hit the floor, your morning cortisol may be blunted.

### 2. You Crash Hard in the Afternoon

That 2-3 PM energy dip isn't just "normal." While some dip is expected, feeling like you need a nap to survive suggests your cortisol is dropping too fast, too early.

### 3. You Get a "Second Wind" at Night

This is the classic sign of a flipped rhythm. Your cortisol is rising when it should be falling, making you alert when you should be sleepy.

### 4. You Wake Up Between 2-4 AM

This often indicates a blood sugar crash (cortisol and blood sugar are tightly linked) or a cortisol spike in the middle of the night when it should be at its lowest.

### 5. You Feel "Tired But Wired"

This paradox—exhausted but unable to relax—is the hallmark of HPA axis dysfunction. Your body is stuck in a stress response it can't turn off.

## What's Actually Happening

Your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is the command center for cortisol production. When you're under chronic stress—whether from work, poor sleep, gut infections, or hidden inflammation—this system can get dysregulated.

The result? Your cortisol curve flattens. Instead of a healthy peak-and-valley pattern, you get a flat line that leaves you dragging all day and wired all night.

## What To Do About It

Here's the thing: you can't fix what you can't see.

Guessing at supplements or sleep hacks without knowing your actual cortisol pattern is like trying to fix a car without looking under the hood.

A **salivary cortisol test** measures your levels at multiple points throughout the day, revealing exactly where your rhythm is broken. From there, we can build a targeted protocol to restore healthy function.

This is exactly what we do in the D.R.E.S.S. protocol—using data to drive decisions, not guesswork.
